## Constellation Comparisons

Each file plots the error rate vs. SNR for different constellations using Monte Carlo Analysis. We create random message bits, encode them by the given constellations, disrupt them by Gaussian Noise and then decode them to measure the errors. 

You can just run each file to get the plot.
